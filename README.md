# Openai_swarm_rag_implementation


This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of OpenAI Swarm for multi-agent orchestration with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system showcases how agents work together to perform tasks like text summarization, sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and document search using FAISS and OpenAI's language models.

Features

1.Multi-Agent System: Utilizes the Swarm framework for orchestrating specialized agents.
2.Text Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis, summarization, and keyword extraction.
3.Document Search: Use FAISS for efficient similarity-based document retrieval.
4.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhance document querying with relevant context and OpenAI language models.
